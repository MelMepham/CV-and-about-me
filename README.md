# Melissa Mepham
## Design / Illustration / Web Dev

Welcome to my Git, please have a look through my work, have a look at my CV and make your self at home! 

My name is Melissa Mepham. I am a trained Javascript Web Dev, Graphic Designer and Artist.

I have just finished a 3 month apprenticeship at Ensipral Dev Academy where we have learnt JavaScript, React.js, Redux, Webpack, HTML, CSS, as well as being exposed to SASS, and the Jest test suite.

At EDA I was working in a team of 10 diverse junior devs. We pair coded every day for 9 weeks along with completing group projects (all using GIT and agile techniques). Through this process we looked at what helps us succeed, where our weaknesses are and how to work at mitigating them both with self awareness, compassion and feedback. All of the work completed at EDA can be found through my Git profile.
